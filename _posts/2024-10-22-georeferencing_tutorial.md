Here's some text about why you'd want to do this, which will show up above the jump.

## 1. Locate and copy a IIIF manifest link for your map

*IIIF manifest links can be found on many digital repository and library sites. Unfortunately, there’s not much standardization across sites as to where to put them in a record, so you may have to dig around for them. Below are screenshots of where to find manifest links on David Rumsey’s website and in Stanford’s Searchworks library catalog.*

***You do not need to get a link from both places, just choose one to use, copy it, and move to step 2.***

### Create Mask *(optional)*

 - In this step you are selecting the part of the image with the map and masking out the rest. **This step is optional, depending on your map.**
